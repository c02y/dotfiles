* Guideline
https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/FAQ.org#should-i-place-my-settings-in-user-init-or-user-config
- Any variable that layer configuration code will read and act on must be set in *user-init*,
- Any variable that Spacemacs explicitly sets but you wish to override must be set in *user-config*.

Anything that isnâ€™t just setting a variable should 99% be in user-config.
