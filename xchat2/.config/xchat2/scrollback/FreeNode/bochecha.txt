T 1353408018 31<chz_>30	You there?
T 1353408027 18<bochecha>	yes
T 1353408061 31<chz_>30	Is there a way that you can let emacs execute several commands in only sentence?
T 1353408088 18<bochecha>	hmmm, first I have never used emacs, so I have no idea
T 1353408094 18<bochecha>	second, do we know each other?
T 1353408117 18<bochecha>	I mean, it's a bit weird to suddenly receive a message out of the blue from someone you don't know
T 1353408123 31<chz_>30	Are you in KH?
T 1353408145 18<bochecha>	I don't know what KH is
T 1353408164 31<chz_>30	HongKong
T 1353408166 18<bochecha>	but again, maybe you want to introduce yourself when you start a conversation with someone who doesn't know you
T 1353408175 18<bochecha>	yes, I'm in Hong KOng
T 1353408190 31<chz_>30	Then you should me
T 1353408206 18<bochecha>	never seen that nickname
T 1353408212 18<bochecha>	and you're not in #linux-hk
T 1353408218 31<chz_>30	I talked to you several times before
T 1353408230 18<bochecha>	on IRC?
T 1353408235 31<chz_>30	yes
T 1353408245 18<bochecha>	don't remember, sorry
T 1353408265 18<bochecha>	and in any case, the convention is to ask somebody before starting a private chat
T 1353408266 31<chz_>30	It's been a while
T 1353408313 18<bochecha>	anyway, I would have been less surprised if you had been in #linux-hk
T 1353408331 18<bochecha>	and you'd have had more chances of getting an answer if you had asked in a public channel ;)
T 1353408383 31<chz_>30	I used to talk in fedora-zh, but the only one that gave me response is you, 
T 1353408403 18<bochecha>	so, you're a fedora user in Hong Kong?
T 1353408442 31<chz_>30	so, this time I talk to you directly
T 1353408453 31<chz_>30	No, I'm in Wuhan
T 1353408453 18<bochecha>	(and I'm really sorry, but I can't remember the names of everybody I'veever talked to on IRC, I hope you can understand)
T 1353408464 18<bochecha>	you should still ask in the public channel
T 1353408479 18<bochecha>	it is considered impolite to start a private conversation uninvited on IRC
T 1353408490 18<bochecha>	I guess you just didn't know, so I won't be mad at you :)
T 1353408501 18<bochecha>	but please try to remember it for the next time
T 1353408510 18<bochecha>	and really, I don't know emacs at all
T 1353408535 18<bochecha>	you'll have more chances to find people who know the answers to your questions in a public channel :)
T 1353408594 31<chz_>30	from the context I talked with you before, it seems that you use emacs
T 1353408605 18<bochecha>	nah
T 1353408626 18<bochecha>	I only have 10 fingers, that's not enough for all these crazy shortcuts :)
T 1353408710 31<chz_>30	Sorry then, for suddenly open a private conversation with you
T 1353408746 18<bochecha>	that's alright
T 1353408749 18<bochecha>	you didn't know, now you do :)
T 1353408876 31<chz_>30	I though you know me. sorry
T 1353408898 31<chz_>30	You gave me a lot  help before
T 1353408928 18<bochecha>	heh, I'm online all day long, so that gives me a lot of time to help other people :)
T 1353408935 18<bochecha>	what did I help you on in the past?
T 1353408941 18<bochecha>	maybe that would remind me something
T 1353408952 31<chz_>30	Yeah, it's really of you
T 1353408995 31<chz_>30	nice of
