[1mNAME[0m
       vifm - vi file manager

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       vifm [OPTION]...
       vifm [OPTION]... LWIN_DIR
       vifm [OPTION]... LWIN_DIR RWIN_DIR

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Vifm  is  a ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings. If you
       use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files  with‚Äê
       out having to learn a new set of commands.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The  vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it
       is given a different directory on the command line.

       [1m<lwinpath>[0m
              Starts Vifm in the specified path.

       [1m<lwinpath> <rwinpath>[0m
              Starts Vifm in the specified paths.

       Paths to files are also allowed in case you want  vifm  to  start  with
       some archive opened.  If you want to select file, prepend its path with
       --select.

       [1m-f     [22monly used from the vifm.vim  script.   The  selected  files  are
              written to $VIFM/vimfiles and vifm exits.

       [1m--logging[0m
              Log  some  errors  to $VIFM/log.  Also /var/log/vifm-startup-log
              (on *nix) and startup-log in the  directory  of  executable  (on
              Windows)  is  used  to  log  startup process (when configuration
              directory isn't determined).

       [1m--remote[0m
              Sends the rest of command line to the active vifm server (one of
              already  running  instances  if  any).  When there is no server,
              quits silently.  There is no limit on how many arguments can  be
              processed.  One can combine --remote with -c <command> or +<com‚Äê
              mand> to execute command in already running  instance  of  vifm.
              See also "Client-Server" section below.

       [1m-c <command> or +<command>[0m
              Run  command-line  mode  <command> on startup.  Commands in such
              arguments are executed in the order they appear in command line.
              Commands with spaces or special symbols must be enclosed in dou‚Äê
              ble or single quotes or all special symbols  should  be  escaped
              (the exact syntax strongly depends on shell).

       [1m--help, -h[0m
              Show an overview of the commandline options.

       [1m--version, -v[0m

       You can use count with commands like yy.

              delete  (count  + 1) files starting from current cursor position
              upward.

[1mRegisters[0m
       vifm supports multiple registers for temporary storing list  of  yanked
       or deleted files.

       Registers should be specified with hitting double quite key followed by
       a register name.  Count is specified after register name.   By  default
       commands use unnamed register, which has double quote as its name.

       Though  all  commands  accept  registers, most of commands ignores them
       (for example H or Ctrl-U).  Other commands can fill register or  append
       new files to it.

       Presently vifm supports ", _, a-z and A-Z characters as register names.

       As mentioned above " is unnamed register and has special meaning of the
       default register.  Every time when you use named registers (a-z and  A-
       Z)  unnamed  register  is  updated to contain same list of files as the
       last used register.

       _ is black hole register.  It can be used for writing, but its list  is
       always empty.

       Registers with names from a to z  and from A to Z are named ones.  Low‚Äê
       ercase registers are cleared before adding new files,  while  uppercase
       aren't and should be used to append new files to the existing file list
       of appropriate lowercase register (A for a, B for b, ...).

       Registers can be changed on :empty command if they contain files  under
       trash directory (see "Trash directory" section below).

       Registers do not contain one file more than once.

       Example:

         "a2yy

       will  put  names  of two files to register a (and to the unnamed regis‚Äê
       ter),

         "Ad

       will remove one file and append its name to  register  a  (and  to  the
       unnamed register),

         p or "ap or "Ap

       will insert previously yanked and deleted files into current directory.

[1mSelectors[0m
       y,  d, D, !, gu and gU commands accept selectors.  You can combine them
       with any of selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.

       Most of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M, %,  f,  F,
       ;, comma, ', ^, 0 and $.  But there are some additional ones.

       [1ma      [22mall files in current view.

       [1ms      [22mselected files.

       [1mS      [22mall files except selected.

       Examples:
        dj - delete file under cursor and one below.
        d2j - delete file under cursor and two below.
        y6gg - yank all files from cursor position to 6th file in the list.

       When you pass a count to whole command and its selector they are multi‚Äê
       plied. So:

              a  range.   Asterisk at the pattern beginning don't match dot in
              the first position.  If you need to insert  comma  into  command
              just  double  it  (",,").  Space followed by an ampersand as two
              last characters of a command means running of the command in the
              background.   Optional  description can be given to each command
              to ease understanding of what command will do in the :file menu.

              (ctermbg) parameters of highlight groups of the current  default
              color scheme.

       Available style values (some of them can be combined):
        - bold
        - underline
        - reverse or inverse
        - standout
        - none

       Available group-name values:
        - Win - color of all windows (views, dialogs, menus)
        - Border - color of vertical parts of the border
        - TopLineSel - top line color of the current pane
        - TopLine - top line color of the other pane
        - CmdLine - the command line/status bar color
        - ErrorMsg - color of error messages in the status bar
        - StatusLine - color of the line above the status bar
        - WildMenu - color of the wild menu items
        - CurrLine - line at cursor position in the view
        - Selected - color of selected files
        - Directory - color of directories
        - Link - color of symbolic links in the views
        - BrokenLink - color of broken symbolic links
        - Socket - color of sockets
        - Device - color of block and character devices
        - Executable - color of executable files
        - Fifo - color of fifo pipes

       Available colors:
        - -1 or default or none - default or transparent
        - black
        - red
        - green
        - yellow
        - blue
        - magenta
        - cyan
        - white

       Light  versions  of  colors are regular colors with bold attribute set.
       So order of arguments of :highlight command is important and it's  bet‚Äê
       ter  to  put  "cterm" in front of others to prevent it from overwriting
       attributes set by "ctermfg" or "ctermbg" arguments.

       Since there are two colors and only one bold attribute it affects  both
       colors  when  "reverse" attribute is used when running vifm in terminal
       emulator.  While linux native console can handle boldness of foreground
       and background colors independently, which is for consistency with ter‚Äê
       minal emulators accessible from vifm only  implicitly  by  using  light
       versions of colors.

       Here  is  the hierarchy of highlight groups, which you need to know for
       using transparency:
         StatusLine
           WildMenu
         Border
         CmdLine
           ErrorMsg
         Win
           Directory
           Link
           BrokenLink
           Socket
           Device
           Fifo
           Executable
             Selected
               CurrLine
         TopLine
           TopLineSel

       "none" means default terminal color for highlight groups at  the  first
       level of the hierarchy and transparency for all others.

               - for boolean options - nooption, invoption and option!
               - for integer options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for string options - option=x
               - for string list options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for enumeration options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for enumeration options - option=x
               - for set options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x
               - for charset options - option=x, option+=x and option-=x

              the meaning:
               - option - turn option on (for boolean) or print its value (for
              all others)
               - nooption - turn option off
               - invoption - invert option state
               - option! - invert option state
               - option? - print option value
               - option& - reset option to its default value
               - option=x or option:x - set option to x
               - option+=x - add x to option
               - option-=x - remove (or subtract) x from option

              Option name can be prepended  and  appended  by  any  number  of
              whitespace characters.

         . - the current position in the filelist.
         $ - the end of the filelist.
         't - the mark position t.

       Examples:

         :%delete

       would delete all files in the directory.

         :2,4delete

       would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.

         :.,$delete

       would  delete  the  files  from  the current position to the end of the
       filelist.

         :3delete4

       would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

       If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
       user can chose what to do next.

       The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

       Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

       Note that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i macros are mutually exclusive. Only the
       last one of them in the command will take effect.

       You  can  use  filename  modifiers  after %c, %C, %f, %F, %b, %d and %D
       macros.  Supported modifiers are:

       - :p           - full path

       - :u             -   UNC   name   of   path   (e.g.    "\\server"    in
         "\\server\share"),  Windows  only.   Expands to current computer name
         for not UNC paths.

       - :~           - relative to the home directory

       - :.           - relative to current directory

       - :h           - head of the filename

       - :t           - tail of the filename

       - :r           - root of the filename (without last extension)

       - :e           - extension of the filename (last one)

       - :s?pat?sub?  - substitute the first occurrence of pat with sub.   You
         can use any character for '?', but it must not occur in pat or sub.

       - :gs?pat?sub?  -  like :s, but substitutes all occurrences of pat with
         sub.

         See ':h filename-modifiers' in Vim's documentation for  the  detailed
         description.

         Using  %x  means  expand  corresponding macro escaping all characters
         that have special meaning.  And %"x means using of double quotes  and
         escape only backslash and double quote characters, which is more use‚Äê
         ful on Windows systems.

         Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m, %M, %S or %s macros in
         the  command  is  unimportant.  All their occurrences will be removed
         from the resulting command.

         %c and %f macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F  are
         expanded to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.

       [1m:com move mv %f %D[0m
         would  set the :move command to move all of the files selected in the
         current directory to the other directory.

       The %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into  the
       command.  All arguments are considered optional.  ":com lsl !!ls -l %a"
       will set the lsl command to execute ls -l with or without an argument.

       [1m:lsl<Return>[0m
         will list the directory contents of the current directory.

       [1m:lsl filename<Return>[0m
         will list only the given filename.

       The macros can also be used in directly executing  commands.  ":!mv  %f
       %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other direc‚Äê
       tory.

       Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the
       background.Typically  you want to run two kinds of external commands in
       thebackground:
          - GUI applications that doesn't fork thus block vifm (:!sxiv %f &);
          - console tools that do not work with terminal (:!mv %f %D &).

       You don't want to run terminal commands, which require  terminal  input
       oroutput something because they will mess up vifm's TUI. Anyway, if you
       did runsuch a command, you can use Ctrl-L key to update vifm's TUI.

       Rewriting the example command with macros given above with  background‚Äê
       ing:

          :!mv %f %D &

       Note that %m, %M, %s, %S and %i macros have bigger priority than &.  So
       command containing at least one of them can't be backgrounded and "  &"
       at the end will be just silently ignored.

[1mCommand backgrounding[0m
       Copy  and move operation can take a lot of time to proceed.  That's why
       vifm supports backgrounding of this  two  operations.   To  run  :copy,
       :move  or :delete command in the background just add " &" at the end of
       a command.

       For each background operation a new thread will be created.   Currently
       job cannot be stopped or paused.

       You  can  see  if  command  is  still running in the :jobs menu.  Back‚Äê
       grounded commands have progress instead  of  process  id  at  the  line
       beginning.

       Background operations cannot be undone.

              Determines the content of the ruler.  Its width is 13 characters
              and it's right aligned.  Following macros are supported:
               %l - file number
               %L - total number of files in view (including filtered)
               %- - number of filtered files
               %S - number of showed files

       ".." indicates that the operations in this level can be concatenated.

       expr1
       -----
       expr2 {cmp} expr2

       Compare two expr2 expressions, resulting in a  0  if  it  evaluates  to
       false or 1 if it evaluates to true.

       equal     ==
       notequal  !=

       Examples:

       ------
       "string"             string constant

       Note that double quotes are used.

       A string constant accepts these special characters:
       \b      backspace <bs>
       \e      escape <esc>
       \n      newline

       Note that single quotes are used.

       This  string  is  taken as it is.  No backslashes are removed or have a
       special meaning.  The only exception is that two quotes stand  for  one
       quote.

       Examples:

       The result is a string, which represents file type and is  one  of  the
       list:
           exe    executables
           reg    regular files
           link   symbolic links

[1mStartup[0m
       On  startup  vifm determines several variables that are used during the
       session.  They are determined in the order they appear below.

       On *nix systems $HOME is normally present and used as is.   On  Windows
       systems  vifm  tries  to  find  correct home directory in the following
       order:
        - $HOME variable;
        - $USERPROFILE variable;
        - a combination of $HOMEDRIVE and $HOMEPATH variables.

       vifm tries to find correct configuration directory by checking the fol‚Äê
       lowing places:
        - $VIFM variable;
        - parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
        - $HOME/.vifm directory;
        - $APPDATA/Vifm directory (on Windows only).

       vifm tries to find correct configuration file by checking the following
       places:
        - $MYVIFMRC variable;
        - vifmrc in parent directory of the executable file (on Windows only);
        - $VIFM/vifmrc file.

[1mConfigure[0m
       See Startup section above for the explanations on $VIFM and $MYVIFMRC.

       The vifmrc file  contains  commands  that  will  be  executed  on  vifm
       startup.   See $MYVIFMRC variable description for search algorithm used
       to find vifmrc.  Use it to set settings, mappings, filetypes  etc.   To
       use multi line commands precede each next line with a slash (whitespace
       before slash is ignored, but all spaces at the end  of  the  lines  are
       saved).  For example:
         set
             \smartcase
       equals "setsmartcase".  When
         set<space here>
             \ smartcase
       equals "set  smartcase".

       The  $VIFM/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may edit it by
       hand to change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that,  edit
       vifmrc  instead.   You  can  control  what  settings  will  be saved in
       vifminfo by setting ¬¥vifminfo' option.  Vifm always writes this file on
       exit unless 'vifminfo' option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory
       history, filetypes, fileviewers and registers in the  file  are  merged
       with vifm configuration (which has bigger priority).

       The  $VIFM/scripts  directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
       it's PATH environment variable to let user run  those  scripts  without
       specifying  full path.  All subdirectories of the $VIFM/scripts will be
       added to PATH too.  Script in a subdirectory overlaps script  with  the
       same name in all its parent directories.

       The $VIFM/colors directory contains color schemes.

[1mAutomatic FUSE mounts[0m
       vifm has a builtin support of automated FUSE file system mounts.  It is
       implemented using file associations  mechanism.   To  enable  automated
       mounts,  one needs to use a specially formated program line in filetype
       or filextype commands.  Currently two formats are supported:

       1) FUSE_MOUNT This format should be used in case when  all  information
       needed  for  mounting all files of a particular type is the same.  E.g.
       mounting of tar files don't require any file specific options.

       Format line:
         FUSE_MOUNT|mounter %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

       Example filetype command:
         :filetype FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR

       2) FUSE_MOUNT2 This format allows one to use specially formatted  files
       to  perform  mounting  and  is useful for mounting remotes, for example
       remote file systems over ftp or ssh.

       Format line:
         FUSE_MOUNT2|mounter %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR [%CLEAR]

       Example filetype command:
         :filetype FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR

       Example file content:
           root@127.0.0.1:/

       All % macros are expanded by vifm at runtime  and  have  the  following
       meaning:
         - %SOURCE_FILE is replaced by full path to selected file
         - %DESTINATION_DIR is replaced by full path to mount directory, which
       is created by vifm basing on the value of 'fusehome' option.
         - %PARAM value is filled from the first line of  file  (whole  line),
       though in the future it can be changed to whole file content
         -  %CLEAR  means  that  you want to clear screen before running mount
       command.

       %CLEAR is an optional macro.  Other macros are not mandatory, but mount
       commands likely won't work without them.

       The  mounted  FUSE  file systems will be automatically unmounted in two
       cases:

       - when vifm quits (with ZZ, :q, etc. or when killed by signal)

       - when you explicitly leave mount point going up to its  parent  direc‚Äê
         tory  (with  h,  Enter on "../" or ":cd ..") and other pane is not in
         the same directory or its child directories.

[1mView look[0m
       vifm supports displaying of file list view in two different ways:

       - in a table mode, when multiple columns can be set using 'viewcolumns'
         option (see Column view section below for details);

       - in  a multicolumn list manner which looks almost like `ls -x` command
         output (see ls-like view section below for details).

       The look is local for each view and can be chosen by changing value  of
       the ¬¥lsview' boolean option.

       Depending  on view look some of keys change their meaning to allow more
       natural cursor moving.  This concerns mainly h, j, k, l and other simi‚Äê
       lar navigation keys.

       Also  some of options can be ignored if they don't affect view display‚Äê
       ing in selected look.  For example value of 'viewcolumns' when 'lsview'
       is set.

[1mls-like view[0m
       When this view look is enabled by setting 'lsview' option on, vifm will
       display files in multiple columns.  Number of columns  depends  on  the
       length  of  the  longest  file name present in current directory of the
       view.  Whole file list is automatically reflowed on  directory  change,
       terminal or view resize.

       View looks close to output of `ls -x` command, so files are listed left
       to right in rows.

       In this mode file manipulation commands (e.g. d) don't  work  line-wise
       like  they  do in Vim, since such operations would be uncommon for file
       manipulating tasks.  Thus, for example, dd  will  remove  only  current
       file.

[1mColumn view[0m
       View columns are described by a comma-separated list of column descrip‚Äê
       tions, each of which has the following format
           [ '-' ] [ fw ( [ '.' tw ] | '%' ) ] '{' type '}' '.'{0,3}
       where fw stands for full width and tw stands for text width.

       So it basically consists of four parts:
        1. Optional alignment specifier
        2. Optional width specifier
        3. Mandatory column name
        4. Optional cropping specifier

       Alignment specifier

       It's an optional minus sign as the first symbol of the string.

       Specifies type of text alignment within a column.  Two types  are  sup‚Äê
       ported:

       - left align
              set viewcolumns=-{name}

       - right align (default)
              set viewcolumns={name}

       Width specifier

       It's  a  number  followed  by  a  percent sign, two numbers (second one
       should be less than or equal to the first one) separated with a dot  or
       a single number.

       Specifies column width and its units. There are tree size types:

       - absolute size - column width is specified in characters
              set viewcolumns=-100{name},20.15{ext}
         results  in  two  columns  with  lengths of 100 and 20 and a reserved
         space of five characters on the left of second column.

       - relative (percent) size - column width is specified  in  percents  of
         view width
              set viewcolumns=-80%{name},15%{ext},5%{mtime}
         results  in three columns with lengths of 80/100, 15/100 and 5/100 of
         view width.

       - auto size (default) - column width is automatically determined
              set viewcolumns=-{name},{ext},{mtime}
         results in three columns with length of  one  third  of  view  width.
         There  is no size adjustment to content, since it will slow down ren‚Äê
         dering.

       Columns of different sizing types can be  freely  mixed  in  one  view.
       Though  sometimes  some  of columns can be seen partly or be completely
       invisible if there is not enough space to display them.

       Column name

       This is just a sort key surrounded with curly braces, e.g.
           {name},{ext},{mtime}
       {name} and {iname} keys are the same and present both  for  consistency
       with ¬¥sort' option.

       Empty  curly braces ({}) are replaced with the default secondary column
       for primary sort key. So after the next command view will be  displayed
       almost  as if 'viewcolumns' is empty, but adding ellipsis for long file
       names:
           set viewcolumns=-{name}..,6{}.

       Cropping specifier

       It's from one to three dots after closing curly brace in column format.

       Specifies type of text truncation if it doesn't fix in the column. Cur‚Äê
       rently tree types are supported:

       - truncation - text is truncated
              set viewcolumns=-{name}.
         results in truncation of names that are too long too fit in the view.

       - adding  of  ellipsis  -  ellipsis on the left or right are added when
         needed
              set viewcolumns=-{name}..
         results in that ellipsis are added at the end of too long file names.

       - none (default) - text can pass column boundaries
              set viewcolumns=-{name}...,{ext}
         results in that long file names can partially be written on  the  ext
         column.

[1mColor schemes[0m
       The color schemes in vifm can be applied in two different ways:

       - as the default (or main) color scheme

       - as local to a panel color scheme

       Both  types are set using |vifm-:colorscheme| command, but of different
       forms:

       - :colorscheme color_scheme_name - for the default color scheme

       - :colorscheme color_scheme_name directory - for local color schemes

       Look of different parts of the TUI (Text User Interface) is  determined
       in this way:

       - Border,  TopLineSel, TopLine, CmdLine, ErrorMsg, StatusLine and Wild‚Äê
         Menu are always determined by the default color scheme

       - CurrLine, Selected, Directory, Link, BrokenLink, Socket, Device, Exe‚Äê
         cutable,  Fifo  and  Win are determined by default color scheme and a
         set of local colorschemes, which can be empty

       There might be a set of local color schemes because they are structured
       hierarchically  according to file system structure. For example, having
       the following piece of file system:

        ~
        `-- bin
           |
           `-- my

       Two color schemes:

        # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin
        highlight Win cterm=none ctermfg=white ctermbg=red
        highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=red ctermbg=black

        # ~/.vifm/colors/for_bin_my
        highlight CurrLine cterm=none ctermfg=green ctermbg=black

       And these three commands in the vifmrc file:

        colorscheme Default
        colorscheme for_bin ~/bin
        colorscheme for_bin_my ~/bin/my

       File list will look in the following way for each level:

       - ~/ - Default color scheme
         black background
         cursor with blue background

       - ~/bin/ - mix of Default and for_bin color schemes
         red background
         cursor with black background and red foreground

       - ~/bin/my/ - mix of Default, for_bin and for_bin_my color schemes
         red background
         cursor with black background and green foreground

[1mTrash directory[0m
       vifm has support of trash directory, which is used as temporary storage
       for deleted files or files that were cut.  Using trash is controlled by
       the ¬¥trash' option, and exact  path  to  the  trash  can  be  set  with
       'trashdir'  option.   Trash  directory in vifm differs from the system-
       wide one by default, because of possible incompatibilities  of  storing
       deleted   files  among  different  file  managers.   But  one  can  set
       'trashdir' to "~/.local/share/Trash" to use a "standard"  trash  direc‚Äê
       tory.

       There are two scenarios of using trash in vifm:

       1.  As  a  place  for  storing  files  that  were cut by "d" and may be
           inserted to some other place in file system.

       2.  As a storage of files, that are deleted but not purged yet.

       The first scenario uses deletion ("d") operations to put files to trash
       and  put  ("p") operations to restore files from trash directory.  Note
       that such operations move files to and from trash directory, which  can
       be  long  term  operations  in  case  of different partitions or remote
       drives mounted locally.

       The second scenario uses deletion ("d") operations for moving files  to
       trash directory and :empty command-line command to purge all previously
       deleted files.

       Deletion and put operations depend on registers,  which  can  point  to
       files  in trash directory.  Normally, there are no nonexistent files in
       registers, but vifm doesn't keep track  of  modifications  under  trash
       directory,  so one shouldn't expect value of registers to be absolutely
       correct if trash directory was modified not by operation that are meant
       for  it.  But this won't lead to any issues with operations, since they
       ignore nonexistent files.

[1mClient-Server[0m
       vifm supports remote execution of command-line mode commands as well as
       remote  changing  of directories.  This is possible using --remote com‚Äê
       mand-line argument.

       To execute a command remotely combine --remote argument with  -c  <com‚Äê
       mand> or +<command>.  For example:
           vifm --remote -c 'cd /'
           vifm --remote '+cd /'

       To  change directory not using command-line mode commands one can spec‚Äê
       ify paths right after --remote argument, like this:
           vifm --remote /
           vifm --remote ~
           vifm --remote /usr/bin /tmp

       At the moment there is no way of specifying,  which  instance  of  vifm
       should  arguments be sent.  The main purpose of --remote argument is to
       provide support of using vifm as a single-instance application.

[1mPlugin[0m
       Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

       Commands:

         :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
         :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
         :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a  file  or  files  to
       open.
         :DiffVifm    select  a  file  or files to compare to the current file
       with
                     :vert diffsplit.
         :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

       Each command accepts up to two arguments: left pane directory and right
       pane  directory.   After arguments are checked, vifm process is spawned
       in a special "file-picker" mode.  To pick files just open  them  either
       by  pressing  l,  i  or Enter keys, or by running :edit command.  If no
       files are selected, file under the cursor is  opened,  otherwise  whole
       selection is passed to the plugin and opened in vim.

       The  plugin  have  only  two  settings.   It's  a string variable named
       g:vifm_term to let user  specify  command  to  run  gui  terminal.   By
       default  it's  equal  to ¬¥xterm -e'.  And another string variable named
       g:vifm_exec, which equals "vifm"  by  default  and  specifies  path  to
       vifm's  executable.   To  pass  arguments to vifm use g:vifm_exec_args,
       which is empty by default.

       To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file  to  either  the  system  wide
       vim/plugin directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

       If  you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide
       plugin directory add

       let loaded_vifm=1

       to your ~/.vimrc file.
