.SS NAME
.PP
autojump \- a faster way to navigate your filesystem
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem.
It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most
from the command line.
.PP
\f[I]Directories must be visited first before they can be jumped to.\f[]
.SS USAGE
.PP
\f[C]j\f[] is a convenience wrapper function around \f[C]autojump\f[].
Any option that can be used with \f[C]autojump\f[] can be used with
\f[C]j\f[] and vice versa.
.IP \[bu] 2
Jump To A Directory That Contains \f[C]foo\f[]:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
j\ foo
\f[]
.fi

Jump To A Child Directory:
.RS 2
.PP
Sometimes it\[aq]s convenient to jump to a child directory
(sub\-directory of current directory) rather than typing out the full
name.

Open File Manager To Directories (instead of jumping):
.RS 2
.PP
Instead of jumping to a directory, you can open a file explorer window
(Mac Finder, Windows Explorer, GNOME Nautilus, etc.) to the directory
instead.

.nf

.PP
Opening a file manager to a child directory is also supported:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
jco\ images
\f[]

Using Multiple Arguments:
.RS 2
.PP
Let\[aq]s assume the following database:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
30\ \ \ /home/user/mail/inbox
10\ \ \ /home/user/work/inbox
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[C]j\ in\f[] would jump into /home/user/mail/inbox as the higher
weighted entry.
However you can pass multiple arguments to autojump to prefer a
different entry.
In the above example, \f[C]j\ w\ in\f[] would then change directory to
/home/user/work/inbox.

.SS KNOWN ISSUES
.IP \[bu] 2
autojump does not support directories that begin with \f[C]\-\f[].
.IP \[bu] 2
For bash users, autojump keeps track of directories by modifying
\f[C]$PROMPT_COMMAND\f[].
Do not overwrite \f[C]$PROMPT_COMMAND\f[]:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ PROMPT_COMMAND="history\ \-a"
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Instead append to the end of the existing $PROMPT_COMMAND:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export\ PROMPT_COMMAND="${PROMPT_COMMAND:+$PROMPT_COMMAND\ ;}\ history\ \-a"
\f[]
.fi
